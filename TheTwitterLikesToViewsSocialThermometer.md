# The Twitter likes to views ratio as a social thermometer

Elon Musk's exposure to all of us of the Twitter thermometer of social
likability has profound meaning for all of us. It is an imperfect
thermometer of what we like and it is probably one of the main ways that
Twitter maximizes ad revenue on its platform. How do I know, because for
more than 10 years I have worked in the ad-tech industry and as a scientist
this would be one of the most important tools for carrying out that
optimization.

Its flaws and strengths can tell us a lot about ourselves and how any
instrument, cannot answer all the questions we have. But it is far better
to have these imperfect tools than not.

Terminology: This essay will treat the metric of likes to views as an
imperfect measurement device. From now on we will call it the
LikesToViews Thermometer (LtV Thermometer). There are many more ways
to look at this metric. From its business strategy point of view,
from its social manipulation point of view, etc. Here I want to focus
on how this instrument gives some insight into the questions we want
to answer but not all.

## 1. We are better off for knowing the likes to view ratio

Let us agree that all judges, all experts are imperfect. So it is with simple
instruments of the truth. The LtV thermometer is no different.
