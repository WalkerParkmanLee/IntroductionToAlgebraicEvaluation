# The Twitter likes to views ratio as a social thermometer

Elon Musk's simple tweet of the average likes to views ratio  
(~1/100) has just calibrated our private views of our own tweets
in the Twitter Agora. It is an imperfect
thermometer of what we like and it is probably one of the main ways that
Twitter maximizes ad revenue on its platform. How do I know? For
more than 10 years I have worked in the ad-tech industry.
Simple statistics like these are the only levers available to a business
like Twitter. They are simple, but very effective levers for
extracting income - ad revenue - from our social likes, beliefs, prejudices,
and hates.

Its flaws and strengths can tell us a lot about ourselves and how any
instrument, cannot answer all the questions we have. But it is far better
to have these imperfect tools than not.

Terminology: This essay will treat the metric of likes to views as an
imperfect measurement device. From now on we will call it the
LikesToViews Thermometer (LtV Thermometer). There are many more ways
to look at this metric. From its business strategy point of view,
from its social manipulation point of view, etc. Here I want to focus
on how this instrument gives some insight into the questions we want
to answer but not all.

## 1. We are better off for knowing the likes to view ratio

Let us agree that all judges, all experts are imperfect. So it is with simple
instruments of the truth. The LtV thermometer is no different.

## 2. Ways to use the LtV thermometer to communicate better

### 2a. Study the views as your thread progresses

Anyone can fall into the unsuspecting web of your dark thoughts. The views
that you get on an initial tweet are not necessarily reflective of a
reader's engagement. They may have landed on your tweet because you were
trolling a conversation, etc.

If your goal is to be heard, to write engaging content that grabs people's
attention, you want to measure precisely that - engagement. And one good
way to do so is to look at just the decay of views in your threads.

Not everyone is interested in your angle on a story. They would like to move
on. So views in your threads should mostly decline (you could have a viral
tweet embeded in the thread!). Use this to polish your writing and experiment
with new messages and ways to say it.

## 3. The evil side of safety engineering is trapping

It is a well-known adage that the smartest people to scam are the smartest.
Why? There are probably many reasons I do not know. But one that I think may
be at play is our old foe - the fallacy of "only-intelligent" evaluation. That
only those more intelligent than us, can understand us and evaluate us correctly.
That we need to understand something to control it. That we have to be intelligent
to manipulate beings more intelligent than ourselves.

First off, when the space aliens smarter than us land, all of us are going to
have to learn how to scam those smarter than us.
