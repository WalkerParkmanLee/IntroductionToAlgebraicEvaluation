# The Twitter likes to views ratio as a social thermometer

Elon Musk's exposure to all of us of the Twitter thermometer of social
likability has profound meaning for all of us. It is an imperfect
thermometer of what we like and it is probably one of the main ways that
Twitter maximizes ad revenue on its platform. How do I know? For
more than 10 years I have worked in the ad-tech industry.
Simple statistics like these are the only levers available to a business
like Twitter. They are simple, but very effective levers for
extracting income - ad revenue - from our social likes, beliefs, prejudices,
and hates.

Its flaws and strengths can tell us a lot about ourselves and how any
instrument, cannot answer all the questions we have. But it is far better
to have these imperfect tools than not.

Terminology: This essay will treat the metric of likes to views as an
imperfect measurement device. From now on we will call it the
LikesToViews Thermometer (LtV Thermometer). There are many more ways
to look at this metric. From its business strategy point of view,
from its social manipulation point of view, etc. Here I want to focus
on how this instrument gives some insight into the questions we want
to answer but not all.

## 1. We are better off for knowing the likes to view ratio

Let us agree that all judges, all experts are imperfect. So it is with simple
instruments of the truth. The LtV thermometer is no different.

## 2. Ways to use the LtV thermometer to communicate better

### 2a. Study the views as your thread progresses

Anyone can fall into the unsuspecting web of your dark thoughts. The views
that you get on an initial tweet are not necessarily reflective of a
reader's engagement. They may have landed on your tweet because you were
trolling a conversation, etc.

If your goal is to be heard, to write engaging content that grabs people's
attention, you want to measure precisely that - engagement. And one good
way to do so is to look at just the decay of views in your threads.

Not everyone is interested in your angle on a story. They would like to move
on. So views in your threads should mostly decline (you could have a viral
tweet embeded in the thread!). Use this to polish your writing and experiment
with new messages and ways to say it.
