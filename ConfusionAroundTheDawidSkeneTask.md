# Why is everyone so confused about the Dawid/Skene task?

Can you use the crowd to evaluate itself? This question is frequently
confused with its intellectual twin - can we use the crowd to decide?
This later use of the crowd, frequently going under the phrase "Wisdom of
Crowd" and expressed mathematically by, say, majority voting is not what
I wart to talk about.

The other, largely unknown use of the crowd is, not to decide, but to
evaluate. It goes back to a paper in 1977 by Dawid and Skene. My main
argument in this essay is that the AI community was set off on a dead end
when it continued to attack the Dawid/Skene task only using methods based
on measure theory. Since our central mathematical theorem is, in fact,
an exact algebraic solution of the Dawid/Skene model let us try to disentangle
the confusion caused by just viewing evaluation with measure theory lenses.

## The Dawid/Skene task

I want to separate the Dawid/Skene task from what is commonly refered to in the
measure theory literature as "the Dawid/Skene model" - basically the
assumption that the classifiers are error independent. The task is to evaluate
the classifiers using just their noisy response.

The Dawid/Skene model is one way to solve the task. It assumes the classifiers
are error independent on the sample.
