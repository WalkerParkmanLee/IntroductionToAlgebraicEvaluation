This notebook will detail the algebraic geometry computations that take us \
from the \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]evaluation ideal\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
created from the voting patterns of a trio of binary classifiers to the \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]evaluation variety\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]. An \
evaluation ideal is a set of polynomials connecting observable voting pattern \
frequencies by the classifiers to unknown sample statistics of the ground \
truth that are our evaluation goal. We want to \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]grade\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] the classifiers using only the frequencies of their \
voting patterns.

That \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]grade\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] exists in sample \
statistics space. The test has already been taken. We have the decisions of \
the judges. We are faced with the task of grading them now. Not in the \
future, not in the past. This is another example of how the task of \
evaluation is much simpler than that of training. We have to estimate \
something that already exists, if you will. And there is only one time we \
have to do it. Training is much harder. You must create judges that, in the \
future, will behave correctly. And they have to do it many times. The task of \
evaluation is trivial in comparison. Why have we not conquered this much \
simpler space of the whole enterprise of learning?\
