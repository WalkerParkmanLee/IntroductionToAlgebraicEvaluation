```{warning}
This library is under heavy development and is presently meant only
for research and educational purposes. AI or any safety engineering is
not solvable by any one tool. These tools are meant to be part of a broader
safety monitoring system and are not meant as standalone solutions.
NTQR algorithms are meant to complement, not supplement, other safety tools.
