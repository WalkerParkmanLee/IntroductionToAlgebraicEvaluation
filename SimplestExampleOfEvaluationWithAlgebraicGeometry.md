# The simplest introduction to algebraic geometry for evaluation

THe machinery of algebraic geometry is complicated and mostly unfamiliar
to ML experts. This explanation is the simplest way to construct an evaluation
that can then illustrate all the relevant algebraic concepts and how they allow
us to grade noisy judges on unlabeled data.

The work that will be accomplished here can be summarized in this single image,
