# The forgoteen radical empiricism of Henri Victor Regnault

Hasok Chang has written an award winning book on measurement and scientific
progress. It is called "Inventing Temperature". In it I discovered a
forgotten luminary of 19th century empirical science - Henri Victor Regnault.
History and theory has run over his ideas. Chang resurrected them for us.
Regnault's radical empiricism is the intellectual grandfather of algebraic
evaluation. He contested the claim that is still rampant in all sciences -
we need more theory to understand our previous theory.

The similarity of this paradox - must we use more theory to check the theory
of the instrument/brain we are evaluating? - to the issue of safety from any
technology is striking. Particularly so when we amplify it by considering
the task of verifying a super intelligent being's responses to a test we gave
them. If it was on a subject they knew more about, how could we tell they are
wrong?
