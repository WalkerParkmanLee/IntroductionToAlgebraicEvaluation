Hasok Chang has written an award winning book on measurement and scientific
progress. It is called "Inventing Temperature". In it I discovered a
forgotten luminary of 19th century empirical science - Henri Victor Regnault.
History and theory has run over his ideas. Chang resurrected them for us.
Regnault's radical empiricism is the intellectual grandfather of algebraic
evaluation. He contested the claim that is still rampant in all sciences -
we need more theory to understand our previous theory.

The similarity of this paradox - must we use more theory to check the theory
of the instrument/brain we are evaluating? - to the issue of safety from any
technology is striking. Particularly so when we amplify it by considering
the task of verifying a super intelligent being's responses to a test we gave
them. If it was on a subject they knew more about, how could we tell they are
wrong?

Regnault was working at the dawn of our understanding of atoms and certainly
very far from any ideas about statistical thermodynamics. Did he know any of
this theory to certify the precision of his instruments and his mastery of
the craftmanship it required? No. Did he need it? No.

If $n$ experts disagree, at least $n-1$ must be wrong. If the truth is contested,
at least someone is not understanding it. One can look at this table and count
how many digits of agreement exist between them. We can also see which tends to
disagree most with the others, etc. We were able to tell all of that from just these
numbers. I am not even sure what all the different thermometers look like. I do
not need to. Neither do you. They disagree.

This insight can be made mathematically precise by using ideas from compressed
sensing.
